#Recap

We've come a long way since we started developing our first CanJS application. Nice work! Together, we've covered:

- The recommended application structure.
- Building can.Components.
- Binding to templates with can.view.
- Accessing service-exposed data with can.Model. 
- Interrupting service calls to mimic server responses with can.fixture.
- Tying the application together with an Application State object.
- Binding the Application State object with the base template, and the application's route to enable routing.
- Using can.route to make custom routes.

Those are all the pieces you need to start building applications with CanJS today. If you're interested in more advanced topics, like using CanJS with Dependency Management utilities like StealJS, Require, or Browserify, see the [appendices](#appendices) for more information.
